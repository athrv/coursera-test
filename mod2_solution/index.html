<h1>Apparel Breakdown</h1>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="col-1"><h2 style="background-color: lightblue;">Basics</h2>
		Mostly basics shouldn't be very colourful i.e use mostly plain colours.Dont make basics too fancy.Usually dont let there be too much contrast between your vest and shorts or trousers.And try avoiding very bright and flashy colours like neon and all.It really doesen't look that good.Don't try being too classy about basics.Choose in a very decent manner and make it fit.You are set!
		</div>
		<div class="col-2"><h2 style="background-color: pink;">Go-Outs</h2>The things to remember about go outs is again that it should Fit!Telling you this again becasue it really is so important.In Go-outs it is okay to experiment and style up,as long as it looks good.Whatever you wear,look bold and confident.
		Go-outs are the apparels that I believe are the most used.So you can mix and match and try all the different combinations.So expreiment and go with what looks good. There are so many brands to shop from.</div>
		<div class="col-3"><h2 style="background-color: lightgreen;">Formals</h2>Suits!I believe that a suit is the most supreme form of clothing.Every man must own at least one of his own suit.Suits are regal,they represent decency.There is nothing like a well tailored man in a well tailored suit.Without a well tailored suit,your wardrobe is incomplete!
		Never Never Never Ever,Buy a readymade suit.Its not made for you!A suit is like your skin.You must feel it as a part of yourself.And unless you tailor it to your own body size you wont get that feeling.</div>
